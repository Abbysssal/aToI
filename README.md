## a Ton of Items ##

There are *tons* of suggestions from English and Russian parts of the Streets of Rogue community. So, I made texts for both languages:

<table>
<th><a href="https://github.com/Abbysssal/aToI/blob/master/README.md">English</a></th>
<th><a href="https://github.com/Abbysssal/aToI/blob/master/README-ru.md">Russian</a></th>
</table>

### By they way, feel free to use these ideas in your mods, because I'm probably not going to update aToI anymore ###

● **Quantum Fud** - A very complicated piece of quantum technology. When you eat it, its quantum equivalent clone is consumed, while the original thing remains intact. *(restores 1 hp per use, infinite)*<br/>

> Heh<br/>
> Can you try to make an item that teleports on a random distance?<br/>

![Image](./img/WildBypasser.png)
● **Wild Bypasser** - Warps you in the direction you're facing. Teleports through any amount of walls. *(works like Wall Bypasser, but teleports through any amount of walls)*<br/>
***

> *Voodoo doll, to bind it to a character you need to punch them, works like Alien's hypnosis and gives you access to the victim's inventory*<br/>

![Image](./img/VoodooInactive.png)
● **Blank Voodoo Doll** - Bind it to someone first. Has limited uses. *(target any character to bind the doll to them)*<br/>
![Image](./img/Voodoo.png)
● **Bound Voodoo Doll** - Combine the doll with any weapon/consumable to inflict damage/effects on the victim. Combine with itself to remove the bond. *(combining with melee weapons deals some damage to the victim, ranged weapons - spawns the bullet/projectile into the victim, consumables - forces the victim to use that consumable)*<br/>

> /suggest what if there was like a disguise ability. Kinda like the spy's disguise kit from tf2 except you can only disguise as people you are near (its like the hacking tool but instead of hacking things its disguising as things)<br/>

![Image](./img/SPYTRON3000.png)
● **SPYTRON 3000** - Always wanted to be someone else? Now you can! *(disguises you as the selected character)*<br/>
Currently doesn't work on colors, so you won't be able to fool other players.

> *make a cup of molten chocolate like in the escapists*<br/>

![Image](./img/CupOfMoltenChocolate.png)
● **Cup of Molten Chocolate** - That's a nice drink you're enjoying there... AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH! *(just like in The Escapists 1/2, knocks people out instantly)*<br/>
The only problem is that when you hold the Cup of Molten Chocolate, your character will be seen holding a Water Pistol.<br/>

> *what about a portable ammo dispenser?*<br/>
> *[Abbysssal#2020 14.07.20 5:52] (translated from russian)*<br/>
> *hm, maybe I should make an ammo box instead?*<br/>
> *like, you combine it with a weapon, the weapon is refilled and the ammo box's reserves are decreased*<br/>
> *or should I make both the ammo box and ammo dispenser?*<br/>

![Image](./img/PortableAmmoDispenser.png)
● **Portable Ammo Dispenser** - Use it to refill your ranged weapons' ammo. For money, of course. *(works almost like the regular Ammo Dispenser, but without the extra cost per floor)*<br/>
![Image](./img/AmmoBox.png)
● **Ammo Box** - Combine with any refillable weapon to refill it. *(works like Portable Ammo Dispenser, but it uses its 'durability' instead of money)*<br/>

> *about that, I think it will be better to make a joke book, that allows characters to use Joke. Otherwise, it would be completely useless for everyone, except for Comedian.*<br/>

![Image](./img/JokeBook.png)
● **Joke Book** - Always wanted to be a Comedian? Now you can! (kind of) *(a Joke item with limited uses)*<br/>

![Image](./img/Grindstone.png)
● **Grindstone** - Use on melee weapons to sharpen them. Sharpened weapons will ignore all damage-reducing effects.<br/>
Almost done, I just need to make it so that people get angry when the player hits them.<br/>

> *[ComputerHamster#4423 16.07.20 21:10] (translated from russian)*<br/>
> *It is possible to make the player lose experience (trait "I am the Law"). I'm suggesting to add items, that allow to spend experience for some magical effects.*<br/>
> - *Magical Magazine for firearms, that when attached to a weapon, if you run out of bullets, it will fully refill ammo, but will consume some XP.*<br/>
> - *Magical Hat, that allows you to put an item inside of it and get its copy in exchange for XP, the amount depends on the item cost.*<br/>
> - *Infinite Magical Alcohol Drink. Because alcohol in game has healing properties, it will heal the player, but it will consume some XP in order to make that alcohol.*<br/>
> - *Scroll to enchant melee weapons. Melee weapons with this enchantment, instead of their durability, will spend the player's XP. Also can hit ghosts, because it's Magic!*<br/>
> - *Book of the True Ressurection. Ressurects the dead without turning them into zombies. Uses the player's XP proportionally to the revivee's health. And also increases revivee's opinion to the player - neutrals and below become "Friendly", others' opinion increases by 1 stage than it was before their death.*<br/>
> - *Mage Mantle. Significantly decreases received damage, but when damaged uses XP.*<br/>

Well, that's an idea for a whole separate mod.<br/>

> Here's a new item idea: The Portable Anvil! It lets you get your melee weapons to 150 durability with it in your inventory when you collect duplicates, instead of the max 100.<br/>

> *[! ! ! ! I am very cool#8877 17.07.20 17:28]*<br/>

> *What about a grenade/usb, that will make nearby/selected robot alligned, even if they are hostile (except for the killer robot)*<br/>
***
> *[babzoid1#7584 18.07.20 12:46] (translated from russian)*<br/>
> *Poké Ball. With some chance you can make someone alligned, but they will be small, like a gorilla from the barrel (or a shapeshifter)*<br/>

***

> @Abbysssal you already have one Tf2 refrence in your mod pack, so I propose another one: the piss jar. Throw it down, and when it shatters everyone in a large radius runs away as far as they can from the splatter site. If thrown in property someone owns, that NPC prioritized running over being hostile.<br/>
