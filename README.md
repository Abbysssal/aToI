## a Ton of Items ##

There are *tons* of suggestions from English and Russian parts of the Streets of Rogue community. So, I made texts for both languages:

<table>
<th><a href="https://github.com/Abbysssal/aToI/blob/master/README.md">English</a></th>
<th><a href="https://github.com/Abbysssal/aToI/blob/master/README-ru.md">Russian</a></th>
</table>

● **Quantum Fud** - A very complicated piece of quantum technology. When you eat it, its quantum equivalent clone is consumed, while the original thing remains intact.<br/>

● **Wild Bypasser** - Warps you in the direction you're facing. Teleports through any amount of walls.<br/>

● **Blank Voodoo Doll** - Bind it to someone first. Has limited uses.<br/>
● **Bound Voodoo Doll** - Combine the doll with any weapon/consumable to inflict damage/effects on the victim. Combine with itself to remove the bond.<br/>

● **Identity Stealer** - Steals another character's identity.<br/>
Almost done, I just need to create a sprite and figure out how to change agents' colors<br/>

This fits more as an ability, than an item.<br/>

● **Cup of Molten Chocolate** - That's a nice drink you're enjoying there... AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH!<br/>
The only problem is that when you hold the Cup of Molten Chocolate, your character will be seen holding a Water Pistol.<br/>

The snap particle effect might be a problem.<br/>

I have an idea. A new melee weapon called the Phase Sword. It can hit people through walls without breaking the walls (long reach) and damage ghosts.<br/>
